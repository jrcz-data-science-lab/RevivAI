## Setting Up LLM Providers

RevivAI supports multiple AI providers. You need to configure at least one to use the app's features.

![Setup Screenshot](images/setup.png)

### Supported Providers

RevivAI supports these LLM providers:

- **OpenAI** (GPT-4, GPT-3.5, etc.)
- **Anthropic** (Claude models)
- **Google** (Gemini models)
- **OpenRouter** (Access to multiple models)
- **Ollama** (Local/self-hosted models)
- **Custom API** (Any OpenAI-compatible API)

### Setup Process

1. **Access Setup**: Go to setup from the home page when creating a project, or click "Go to Setup" in project settings.

2. **Choose Provider**: Select your preferred AI provider from the tabs at the top.

3. **Configure Settings**:
   - **API URL**: The endpoint for your chosen provider (pre-filled for popular services)
   - **Model**: Specify the model name (e.g., "gpt-4", "claude-3-sonnet")
   - **API Key**: Your API key for the service

4. **Test Connection**: Click "Test" to verify your settings work correctly.

5. **Save**: Click "Save & Continue" to apply your configuration.

### Getting API Keys

Each provider has different steps to get an API key:

- **OpenAI**: Visit the [OpenAI Developer Portal](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys)
- **Anthropic**: Go to the [Anthropic Console](https://console.anthropic.com/settings/keys)
- **Google**: Access [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey)
- **OpenRouter**: Check [OpenRouter Settings](https://openrouter.ai/settings/keys)

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Most providers require a paid account, though some offer free tiers with limitations.

### Security Note

All API calls are made directly from your browser to the AI provider. RevivAI never stores or sees your API keys or data.

## Uploading Your Code

Before you can chat with your code or generate documentation, you need to upload your codebase to RevivAI.

![Upload Screenshot](images/upload.png)

### Upload Options

RevivAI supports two ways to upload code:

#### 1. Local Files
- **Select Folder**: Click the upload button and select a folder containing your project
- **File Filtering**: Use include/ignore patterns to control which files are uploaded
- **Size Limit**: Individual files larger than 20MB are automatically skipped

#### 2. GitHub Repository
- **Public Repositories**: Enter any public GitHub repository URL
- **Automatic Download**: RevivAI will fetch and process the repository contents

### File Filtering

Control which files are included using glob patterns:

#### Include Patterns
Specify which files to include (comma-separated):
```
src/**/*.js, *.md, package.json
```

#### Ignore Patterns  
Specify which files to exclude (comma-separated):
```
node_modules/**, *.log, dist/**, .git/**
```

> [!WARNING]
> Large codebases can consume many AI tokens and increase costs. Use compression and filtering to optimize your upload.

### Upload Process

1. **Open Upload Dialog**: Click the folder icon in the navigation bar
2. **Choose Method**: Select either "Local Files" or "GitHub Repository"
3. **Configure Filters**: Set include/ignore patterns if needed
4. **Enable Compression**: Check this option to reduce the codebase size for better performance
5. **Upload**: Click "Upload" and wait for processing

![Upload Screenshot](images/upload-done.png)

### Codebase Information

After upload, you'll see:
- **Total Files**: Number of files processed
- **Token Count**: How many AI tokens your codebase uses
- **Largest Files**: Which files use the most tokens
- **Compression Status**: Whether compression was applied

### Managing Codebases

- **View Current**: See details about your uploaded codebase in the upload dialog
- **Upload New**: Replace the current codebase with a new one
